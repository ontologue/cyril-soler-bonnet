## POSITIONING

Still working on becoming a leibnizian "philosophe à notions complètes" — which requires genuine independence and real-world experimentation. The path followed by my carrer is a broken line that proves to be a Peano curve capable of filling the AI plane. An unusual life that happens to have made me a fully functional ontologist. 

*I spent 20 years preparing to be an ontologist before the job title existed.*

**My present career goal:** Become the AI industry's first Chief Philosophical Officer. Few have yet understood how necessary that is.

## WHAT I BRING TO INDUSTRIAL ONTOLOGIES

**Unique perspective from unusual path:**
- Deep understanding of formal logic AND messy reality
- Experience with both abstract reasoning and concrete implementation
- Ability to see conceptual structures across radically different domains
- Comfort navigating incomplete information and contradictory requirements

**Practical philosophy applied:**
- Every industrial system has an implicit ontology - I make it explicit
- Knowledge graphs are Leibniz's *characteristica universalis* finally realized
- Digital twins need philosophers who've actually worked in factories
